# what is NUmpy?
- nd array object (1d, 2d, 3d,..)
- array and matrices (linear algebras, )

# Why Numpy over lists?
- lists are slow and numpy are Faster
- NUmpy uses fixed type

# Why Numpy is Faster?
for eg: 
5 in binary => 0000 0101 (8bits)
for NumPy: Int32 (default) => 32 bits -> 4 bytes
    Int16(2 bytes), Int8(1 byte)

for lists: built in Int type:
    - Size (around 4 bytes)
    - reference count (8 bytes)
    - object type (8 bytes)
    - object value (8 bytes)

- So, faster to read less bytes of memory.
- No need to type check in iteration of objects.
- NumPy utilites contigious memory but dynamic in lists
    Benefits:   - SIMD Vector Processing
                - Efficient Cache utilization

# Applications of NumPy:
- Mathematics (MATLAB Replacement)
- Plotting (Matplotlib)
- Backend (Pandas, connect4, Digital Photography)
- Machine Learning
